    - Right now it's only a prototype so certain features aren't working
      - Step 2 -  You can't use the orange Trigger cards other than the ["play"](https://github.com/hyejinim/draw2code/blob/master/assets/cards/Trigger_Play.png) trigger card; Please only draw with blue pens on the Action cards.
      - Step 3 - You can't reorganize the cards or "throw" the cards that you don't need
